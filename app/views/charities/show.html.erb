    <p>Australia’s big power companies - AGL, EnergyAustralia and Origin - are some of the world’s dirtiest, spewing out carbon pollution that is driving global warming and harming our health at an alarming rate. </p>

    <p>By divesting from the Big Polluters and switching to a clean energy provider today you’re joining a growing network of households and communities that are calling on these companies to get out of fossil fuels and get on with the job of repowering Australia with clean energy from the sun and the wind.</p>

    <p>Make sure you tell your friends, neighbours and colleagues about why you’re standing up to the Big Polluters and encourage them to get involved at www.powerforchange.com.au. And if you haven’t already, make sure you let your energy company know why you’re giving them the flick! Template letters are available for download here.</p>

    <p>The funds raised through this program will go towards 350.org’s work supporting Power For Change to grow in more communities and empower more customers to take action.</p>

    <p>Thanks for standing up to dirty energy!</p>
