    <h2>Our Story</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-2 faded-blue pt10 pb10 pl20 pr20">
    <p>
      Ethical Switch began because we noticed something. No matter how hard we try, the task of consuming ethically is difficult and time-consuming.  Our purpose is to help busy people discover companies that align better with their personal values.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through our research, we empower consumers with the information needed to make their ethical choices.  We then provide a simple, online and fast switch.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our focus is with core household spending –electricity, superannuation and soon to be released, banking!  Choosing more ethical providers can vastly reduce personal carbon footprints and helps reward companies that are doing better business.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unlike other comparison websites, we only offer switches to companies that rate more highly across a range of ethical considerations.  We also made sure that a vast portion of our profits go to our charity partners - every time somebody makes a switch, we donate.
    </p>

    <p>
      Based in Melbourne, we were incubated by a group of passionate volunteers in 2014.  The heart of our business is to empower our awesome not-for-profit partners and that's why we donate over 90% of our profits!
